## Ongoing Research

### Secret Breach Prevention in Software Issue Reports  
*Undergraduate Thesis – BUET* | Feb 2024 – Present  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Rifat Shahriyar  
[View Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23657)  
- Analyzed secret leakage trends in issue reports.  
- Evaluated regex and transformer-based detection models (BERT, RoBERTa).  
- Built a secret detection tool with user study evaluation.

### Secret Detection in Source Codes Using LLMs  
*Research Project – BUET* | Jan 2025 – Present  
- Investigating LLAMA & Mistral models for secret detection in source code.  
- Exploring zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned performance.  
- Aiming to reduce false positives significantly.

### Brain Age Estimation from MRI Data  
*Research Project – BUET* | Dec 2024 – Present  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. M. Sohel Rahman  
- Utilized Vision Transformers (ViT) for MRI-based brain age prediction.  
- Integrated demographic features (e.g., gender) to improve accuracy.
