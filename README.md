## Work & Research Experience  

### Secret Breach Prevention in Software Artifacts  
**Undergraduate Thesis ‚Äì BUET**  
Feb 2024 ‚Äì Present  
- Conducted research under Prof. Dr. Rifat Shahriyar on secret leakage in software issue reports  
- Evaluated regex-based and language model-based approaches (BERT, RoBERTa)  
- Built a secret detection tool and evaluated its effectiveness with a user study  

### Secret Detection in Source Codes Using LLMs  
**Research Project ‚Äì BUET**  
Jan 2025 ‚Äì Present  
- Investigating zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches using LLAMA and Mistral  
- Goal: Improve detection of secrets in codebases using state-of-the-art LLMs  

### Brain Age Estimation from MRI Data  
**Research Project ‚Äì BUET**  
Dec 2024 ‚Äì Present  
- Supervised by Prof. Dr. M. Sohel Rahman  
- Used Vision Transformers (ViT) to extract features from 2D slices of brain MRIs  
- Integrated demographic data like gender to boost prediction accuracy
